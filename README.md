# Modified NCPS for NeuroTensor Integration
This project is a heavily modified version of NCPS (https://github.com/mlech26l/ncps) to work with the NeuroTensor framework (https://github.com/moldenha/NeuroTensor). It is entirely written in C++, with the use of NeuroTensor entirely.

This forms the basis for the liquid neural network implementation in NeuroTensor
